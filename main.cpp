/*A dating app typically incorporates various functionalities to facilitate connections, interactions, and engagement between users. Here are some main functionalities commonly found in dating apps:

User Profiles: Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including basic information, photos, and personal interests. Users can also customize their preferences and set criteria for potential matches.

Matching Algorithm: Employ a matching algorithm that suggests potential matches based on user preferences, interests, location, and other relevant factors. The algorithm aims to connect users with compatible profiles.


Notifications: Offer real-time chat functionality, allowing users to engage in instant messaging with other users who are online. Additionally, push notifications can be sent to users to inform them of new messages, likes, matches, or other relevant activities.

Social Media Integration: Allow users to link their social media accounts (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) to import additional information and photos, providing a more comprehensive view of their interests and lifestyle.

Swipe and Match: Incorporate a swipe-based interface where users can swipe left or right on profiles to indicate interest or disinterest. When two users both express interest in each other by swiping right, it results in a match, enabling them to connect and initiate conversations.*/
